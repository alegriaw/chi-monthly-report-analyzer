# CHI Security Score Monthly Summary Report

## Executive Overview

This month's Customer Health Index analysis reveals **mixed results** in our security posture management across 9 analyzed customers. While we celebrate **1 customer successfully exiting the red zone**, indicating improved security practices, we observe concerning trends that require immediate attention from our TAM teams.

The **low-score trend analysis** shows a **deterioration of 11.1%**, with total customers scoring below 42 increasing from 18 to 20. This net decline of 2 customers represents a critical area requiring focused intervention. The movement analysis reveals **1 customer returning to red status** and **2 new customers entering the high-risk category**, highlighting the dynamic nature of security challenges our customers face.

**Congratulations** to the customer who successfully improved their security posture and exited red status - this demonstrates that targeted engagement and remediation efforts yield positive results. However, the **5 customers missing from CHI** present a significant visibility gap that must be addressed to ensure comprehensive security oversight.

Our TAM teams should **prioritize immediate outreach** to the 2 new high-risk customers and the 1 customer who deteriorated back to red status. The missing 5 customers require urgent re-engagement to restore monitoring capabilities. **Regular quarterly business reviews** focusing on security metrics, combined with proactive security assessments, will help prevent future deterioration.

Moving forward, we recommend **enhanced monitoring protocols** and **accelerated engagement cycles** for at-risk accounts. The current trend indicates that while individual success stories exist, our overall security posture requires systematic improvement to reverse the negative trajectory and protect our customer base effectively.
